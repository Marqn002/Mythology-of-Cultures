This website is about the Deities of three religions, Greek mythology, Hinduism and Buddhism.

Front page: <br>
the front page explains what the website is about and it has links that take the user to the different sections of the website, there are also icons for that take you to social media websites and there is an Icon that takes you to a page of thw website to fill out a form.
I got the icons from the website: https://fontawesome.com/ .

Different pages of the website:<br>
Unfortunately I didn't give myself enough time to fill out the pages of the website other than the social media page and the form page.

Problems: <br>
One of the main problems I have is the fact that the CSS code does not show up on the github page.
